# WeatherAPI Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This is an interactive Weather Dashboard built using Power BI and WeatherAPI.  
It displays real-time weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.  
I created this project by following an online tutorial and implemented it independently for learning.

## Objectives
- Fetch live weather data through WeatherAPI  
- Parse JSON data using Power Query  
- Build a clean, interactive dashboard in Power BI  
- Display KPIs and charts for multiple weather parameters  

## Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- WeatherAPI  
- Power Query (M Language)  
- JSON Parsing  
- DAX (for calculated fields)

## Dashboard Features
- Live weather KPIs  
- Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions
