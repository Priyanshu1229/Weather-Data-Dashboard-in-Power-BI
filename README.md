# Weather-Data-Dashboard-in-Power-BI  
This repository contains the project I developed which visualises live weather data by integrating WeatherAPI into Power BI. The dashboard provides key weather insights (temperature, humidity, wind etc.) for selected locations and is refreshed dynamically.
It’s been built by following a detailed tutorial and then customised by me for learning purposes.
🎯 Objectives

Demonstrate how to fetch live weather data via an API (WeatherAPI) and import it into Power BI.
Clean, transform and visualise the data in Power BI to provide meaningful insights.
Build interactive visuals (charts, maps, KPIs) for weather monitoring.
Enhance my analytics & visualization skills and showcase them in GitHub.

🛠 Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop – for importing data, cleaning it, creating the dashboard.
WeatherAPI (or other weather data source) – for live weather data retrieval.
Power Query / M language – to call API, transform JSON data.
DAX – for creating calculated measures and KPIs in Power BI.
CSV / Excel or intermediate data tables (if used) – for storing or previewing raw API data.
(Optional) Power BI Service – if you published the dashboard online.

🔍 Features & Insights

Fetches live weather data for one or more cities or locations.
Displays current temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
Time-based visuals showing changes over time (if you included historical or forecast data).
Interactive filters/slicers (e.g., by city, by date/time).
Map visual (if employed) showing location and weather conditions.
(Optional) Alert or indicator if weather metrics exceed certain threshold (humidity high, wind high etc.).
Custom formatting, user-friendly dashboard UI.
